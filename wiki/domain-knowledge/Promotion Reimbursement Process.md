# Promotion Creation Process
Let us assume a sample promotion between Kroger Co., an American retail company and Colgate Palmolive Co. Ltd., a Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) Company.

# First Approach from CPG Company
Colgate Palmolive Co. Ltd. approaches Kroger Co. to hold a promotion for their Colgate Toothpaste Tubes. 

# Signing of Deal Sheet
After many negotiation rounds, the details of the promotion deal are finalized. As part of the deal, 
- Kroger agrees to carry out a display promotion for Colgate Toothpastes at 10 of its stores in the Irvine Sales Area. 

In return, Colgate Palmolive agrees to 
- provide display material and stock 
- pay a 10000$ flat fee for carrying the display 
- 50c for each toothpaste box sold from the promotion

The period of the promotion is decided as from 05-01-2023 to 05-31-2023

# Carrying out the promotion
Kroger carries out the promotion as per the contract terms described in the deal sheet.

# Submission of Promotion Proof
After the promotion has been carried out, Kroger submits promotion proof to Colgate Palmolive in the form or:
- Images of the promotion display from multiple angles
- An invoice describing the amount of product sold and the total amount owed by Colgate Palmolive Ltd. 

# Input of Promotion Proof Data
Colgate Palmolive Co. inputs the submitted proof and the invoice to the SAP system and selects the retailer associated with the promotion, i.e., Kroger Co.

# Matching the promotion proof with the actual promotion
The Promotion Validation system matches the submitted promotion proof with the actual promotion using various factors like
- Image Location Metadata to match the exact retail store the promotion is being carried in 
- Detected objects from the promotion
- Details from the invoice

# Validation and Fraud Prevention
- The Fraud Prevention system prevents and flags any potential fraud performed by the retailers by faking the promotion proofs.
